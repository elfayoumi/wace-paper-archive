		Hi everybody, Ollie here. Given recent copyright shenanegans, I have made the difficult decision to
		take down the public-facing papers archive webpage. I will do my best to enable the distribution of
		valuable resources to students, but unfortunately I've decided that I don't have the energy or time
		to fight copyright issues.

		<br /><br />

		Keep an eye on the "WACE Dungeon" Discord, where you may be able to find useful resources. Also, check
		out the code for this webpage!

		<br /><br />

		As usual, best of luck with exams everybody. The fact that you're even here is a testament to your dedication
		to excellence and you should be proud of yourself, no matter how the numbers end up.

		{#if IS_SAFARI}
			Bulk downloading can be a little weird on Safari due to browser constraints. If it doesn't
			work, try Chrome instead.

		<strong>Warning:</strong> papers prior to 2016 follow a different syllabus. It is recommended to
